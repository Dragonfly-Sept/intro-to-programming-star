<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Fara Ramaroson. I came from Administration background to IT</p>
<p>Besides I am an Avon Representative.</p>
<p>Actually, I do some freelance work at Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>
<p>There are few things that could never get part of my life, it is art. I am a keyboard player, composer and also a crafter. I work on different mediums<br>
from paper, vinyl, resin, to silk.</p>
<p> I always want to build a website for my business and for my hobbies so Code the Dream has just given me the opportunity to realize what I dreamed of, and also to become a developer.</p>
